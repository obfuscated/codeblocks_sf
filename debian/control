Description: Code::Blocks integrated development environment (IDE)
 Code::Blocks is the open-source, cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
 It is based on a self-developed plugin framework allowing unlimited extensibility.
 Most of its functionality is already provided by plugins.
 Most important official available plugins (included) are:
    * Compiler frontend to many free compilers
    * Debugger frontend for GDB (and CDB for windows platforms)
    * Source formatter (based on AStyle)
    * Code profiler (based on gprof)
    * Wizard to create new classes
    * Code-completion / class-browser (work in progress)
    * Code statistics (SLOCs etc)
    * Source exporter to PDF/HTML/ODT/RTF
    * Help
    * Keyboard shortcuts configuration
    * Wizard to create new Code::Blocks plugins
    * To-do list
    * GUI RAD builder (wxSmith)
