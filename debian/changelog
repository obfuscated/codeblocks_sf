     scripts that create orig-tarballs and remove Windows prebuilt

     for Nassi-Shneiderman-plugin)
   - Removed Build-Depends for pngnq, wget (was only needed for
     the removed doc-packages)
  * debian/rules
   - Switch to CDBS rules system
   - Add parallel build support
   - Use lzma compression
  * Added option to keep (or remove) winodows dll's from dist-tarball
