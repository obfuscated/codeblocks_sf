Version 1.2 Updated at: 1/25/2006 11:11PM
======================================================

Fixed following bugs / features were added:

+ Tested on Linux (Fedora Core 4) - makefile is now provided !
+ Fixed bug that causes focus lost when using tab+ctrl
+ Added a style to disable the drag and drop 
+ Flickering of buttons was reduced significally
+ Buttons (Left, Right, X) now has nice effects when pressed, hover, clicked
+ Buttons area is now used better - when hiding buttons, more place is left for drawing tabs
+ Notebook style now uses wxWindowBase flag rather then keeping its own member, this allows applying regular style (e.g. wxSIMPLE_BORDER) to the notebook
+ wxFNB_TABS_BORDER_SIMPLE was added and now replacing the wxFNB_BORDER - this flag draw a gentle border around the page container
+ When no tabs in the notebook, the background colour is now set to wxSYS_COLOUR_APPWORKSPACE - this gives more MDI look and feel on Windows
+ Fixed tabs drawing glitches - more space between the images and the text and the tab borders
+ Code clean up - especially the OnPaint() function

Version 1.5  9/13/2006 7:40PM
======================================================

Features:

+ New style added - VC8 style, with curved tabs 
  The new style has the following features
	- Background of tab area can be painted in gradient
	- Colourful tabs - a random gentle colour is generated for each new tab (very cool :))
	
	Note: that the new tab DOES NOT support 'X' button on the tab

+ Build for DLL debug/release was fixed (on windows)
+ Makefile for Linux is now more generic using wx-config tool
+ Several drawing issues were fixed
+ Tabs now has an extra line that separate them from the page

========================================================
Version 2.0 
========================================================

 - Code refactoring: 
   + remove wxStyledNotebook class, the same functionality now exist under wxFlatNotebook
   + All drawing was moved to renderers (wxFlatNotebook.cpp file is now cleaned from drawing)
   + Now using smart_ptr & singleton template classes where ever possible
   
 - Added smart tabbing style with new and easy way to select tabs (request #1527285)
   Once this style is enabled, pressing Ctrl+[Shift]+T will popup a dialog with all the open tabs, another Ctrl+[Shift]+T will run throw the 
   dialog list, until the Ctrl key is released.
   
 - Added new styles:
   wxFNB_SMART_TABS - which enables the above feature
   wxFNB_DROPDOWN_TABS_LIST - which replaces the '<>' (left, right arrows buttons) with a drop down list (popup menu) with all the open tabs
   this feature is similar to VS8 tabs styles.
   
- Fixed a bug in SetSelection - in case that the navigation buttons were hidden, and the selection was not visible, it did not ensure that it will be visible

========================================================
Version 2.1
========================================================

This version is released shortly after 2.0 since v2.0 contained many code changes, I expected feedback from user
which came ... (as expected)

So, the following changes fixes applies to v2.1:

- 'x' button on tabs with VS8 style
- dropping page on foreign notebook that does not have image list, while the page does have caused a crash 
- Drawing problems with VS71 & Fancy style when selecting the bottoms tabs
- DeletePage, RemovePage now accepts second argument to allow user to disable page closing events
- Page changing events are now fired from SetSelection, to fix a problem where only mouse left click allowed users to handle the page changes event (e.g. Ctrl + T did not fire page changes event ... )
- If no right click menu is provided, an event wxEVT_COMMAND_FLATNOTEBOOK_CONTEXT_MENU is fired (a bug that existed preveneted this event to be fired)
- wxFNB_ALLOW_FOREIGN_DND style added (check the demo)
- All xpm files are now located on a single resource file
- the smart tabbing dialog icon, was replaced from PNG to XPM.

========================================================
Version 2.2 13/05/2007
========================================================
- New style was added wxFNB_FF2 - which emulate a mix between Firefox2 & AUI, this style makes the notebook more natural when mixing between AUI & wxFNB
- A built-in customization dialog is now available for customizing the notebook - enable it by rigth-click on 
  empty tab area. The dialog allow customizing the following notebook options:
  + Visual style of the tab (one of 5 styles: FF2, VC8, VC71, defualt, fancy and the default)
  + Changing the navigation style between <> arrows to drop down arrow + menu or none
  + Tab orientation (bottom | upper)
  + Draw border around tab area
  + Enable mouse DClick to close tab
  + DClick closes tab
  + Hide/Show close button (the right far one)
  + Hide/Show close button on active tab
  + Enable/Disable smart tabbing
  + Enable drag and drop (plus foreign DnD)
  + Effect: enable gradient painting for the tab area
  + Effect: enable rnadom tab colour (VC8 only)
  
  There are cases when programmer does not want to provide the user the ability to change some settings, (e.g. add close button to tab), this can be
  prevented by specifiying which options are allowed to be customized:
  wxFlatNotebook::SetCustomizationOptions(), and use with one of the following flags:
	wxFNB_CUSTOM_TAB_LOOK		= 0x00000001,	///< Allow customizing the tab appearance
	wxFNB_CUSTOM_ORIENTATION	= 0x00000002,	///< Allow customizing the tab orientation (upper | bottom)
	wxFNB_CUSTOM_FOREIGN_DRAG	= 0x00000004,	///< Allow accept foreign tabs 
	wxFNB_CUSTOM_LOCAL_DRAG		= 0x00000008,	///< Allow local drag and drop
	wxFNB_CUSTOM_CLOSE_BUTTON	= 0x00000010,	///< Allow customizing close button
	wxFNB_CUSTOM_ALL			= wxFNB_CUSTOM_TAB_LOOK | 
								  wxFNB_CUSTOM_ORIENTATION |
								  wxFNB_CUSTOM_FOREIGN_DRAG |
								  wxFNB_CUSTOM_LOCAL_DRAG |
								  wxFNB_CUSTOM_CLOSE_BUTTON 
	
  
- Close button on tabs is now drawn without the blue rectangle 
- Fixed several rare issues where FNB could crash
- Changed the behavior of the left/right roation arrows to rotate single tab at a time and not bulk
- Fixed minor draw issue on Linux builds (tab's text positioning)
- Sources is now compatible with wx-2.8 branch - IT WILL NOT COMPILE WITH 2.6.3
