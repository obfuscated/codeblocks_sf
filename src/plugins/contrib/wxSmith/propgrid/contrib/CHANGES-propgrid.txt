Version 1.2.10 ( Oct-29-2007 )

  Bugs Fixed:

  - Random crashes when tabbing through properties (bug #1790549).

  - Some string literals provoked warning with GCC 4.2+
    (patch #1788137 by rjmyst3).

  - wxPGPropertyWithChildren::GetValueAsString() returned limited
    value string even if wxPG_FULL_VALUE was given in argFlags
    (patch #1794331 by rjmyst3).

  - SetPropertyClientData did not work in wxPython (it now accepts
    Python object).

  - Various wxMAC fixes by Julian Smart:
    - Avoid spurious focus within OnIdle.
    - Further reduce dependency on wxClientDC.
    - Allow scrollbar to draw properly in combo box dropdown list.
    - wxPropertyGridManager's grid now looks better (removed border).
    - Fixed appearance of ChoiceAndButtonEditor.
    - Better correct editor position.

  - Improved compilation with wxWidgets SVN trunk (2.9).

  - Added makefiles for wxWidgets 2.8.6.



Version 1.2.9 ( Aug-30-2007 )

  New:

  - Summary of children in a parent's value field is now limited to 16
    items or 64 characters, whichever is less (except when editing value).

  - POSIX install script now aborts if bakefile is needed and not found.

  - POSIX install script now offers option to 'sudo make install'.

  - Added wxCode-style version checker macro wxCHECK_PROPGRID_VERSION.

  - Added makefiles for wxWidgets 2.8.5.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - wxFONTFAMILY_TELETYPE was missing from the wxFont's selection of
    font families (fix by rjmyst3).

  - Compiling with GCC 3.3 or earlier did not work unless pythoncode
    sections were removed from propgrid.h.

  - Source files in tar.gz archive did not have UNIX line-endings.

  - Eliminated rare crash-in-dtor scenario (bug #1755747).

  - SetPropertyBackgroundColour() and SetPropertyTextColour() no longer
    recursively affect children which already have custom colour set.

  - SetPropertyPriority() refreshed property even if priority didn't
    actually change (fix by Stefan Battmer).

  - Some issues with wxWidgets SVN trunk (ie. 2.9.0).

  - There was spurious log debug message in
    wxPGPropertyWithChildren::SetValueFromString().



Version 1.2.8 ( Jul-09-2007 )

  New:

  - Read-only flag added for properties (you can use SetPropertyReadOnly
    method; patch #1747422 by Chris Edwards).

  - Added makefiles for wxWidgets 2.8.4.

  - Heavily updated wxPython build scripts (see readme in the Python
    source package for details).


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Failure of make install to copy include files to correct location
    should now finally be fixed (bug #1604887).

  - wxPropertyGrid::Delete() crashed in various (uncommon) situations
    (such as when deleting nested categories).

  - Compile error in some ANSI builds.

  - Compile error with GCC 4.1 or later.

  - Compile and combo box errors with SVN trunk (ie. wxWidgets 2.9).

  - Crash was likely if a property was de-selected when handling event from
    an editor control.

  - Applied various fixes for compiling for wxPython under POSIX system
    (thanks Tijs Michels).



Version 1.2.7 ( Mar-24-2007 )

  New:

  - SetPropertyValue and GetPropertyValue methods for wxLongLong and
    wxULongLong. In addition, added wxLongLongProperty to sampleprops.cpp.

  - Makefiles for wxWidgets 2.8.3, 2.6.4 and CVS (2.9.0).


  Changed:

  - Previously it was possible to create a property with fixed
    children (such as wxFlagsProperty) with no children initially, and then
    populate it afterwards. For improved consistency, this can no longer
    be done in the same way. Instead, you need to call BeginAddChilren just
    prior to starting to add children, and EndAddChildren after populating
    has finished.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Applied following Mac OS X fixes by Julian Smart:
    * Improved placement of text control editor.
    * Improved placement of editor button.
    * Editor controls were larger than intended.
    * There was flicker on resize.

  - On GTK, toolbar height was incorrect.

  - Fixed regression which caused spinctrl editor on GTK to crash on arrow
    click.

  - Fixed regression which caused Freeze/Thaw to work incorrectly.

  - Makefile.in did not have UNIX line endings.

  - In certain rare conditions, wxPropertyGrid could crash when being created
    (patch #1645322 by rjmyst3).

  - Dialog editor of string properties could not set an empty string
    (patch #1672748 by b_betts).

  - NULL pointers of focus events were not handled correctly
    (patch #1675902 by rjmyst3).

  - wxFlagsProperty with zero children could not be replaced (#bug 1675077).

  - String handling code has been modified for wxWidgets CVS (2.9.0) and STL-
    friendliness.

  - Compile problem with wxWidgets 2.6.1 on wxMSW (patch #1671422 by
    Tim Stahlhut).

  - Compile problem in sample if WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_6 was not used with
    wxWidgets 2.8 (bug #1647725).



Version 1.2.6 ( Jan-21-2007 )

  New:

  - SpinCtrl editor re-implemented using wxTextCtrl in combination with
    wxSpinButton. This should resolve vast majority of SpinCtrl issues.
    As a bonus, SpinCtrl now also works with wxFloatProperty (or any
    property which value as string is a number).

  - Added extra style wxPG_EX_AUTO_UNSPECIFIED_VALUES. When specified,
    it is possible to set some properties to unspecified values by editing
    them. Currently, following properties support this:
      * wxIntProperty, wxUIntProperty, and wxFloatProperty: Clear the
        text field.

  - Added extra style wxPG_EX_PROCESS_EVENTS_IMMEDIATELY. When specified,
    ProcessEvent is used to dispatch wxPropertyGridEvents instead of
    AddPendingEvent.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Crash when deleting a property with modified, uncommitted value.

  - Compilation problems with wxWidgets 2.8.0.

  - Compilation problem with MingW (bug #1619351).

  - Compilation problem under Mac OS X (bug #1619350).

  - Compilation failed if wxBitmapComboBox was also used (bug #1622884).

  - Compilation problem when not using precompiled headers.

  - Regression where point size and underlined attribute of wxFontProperty 
    were not interpreted correctly.

  - Various problems if first page of wxPropertyGridManager was removed
    and re-created (patch #1626581 by rjmyst3).

  - Properties using ComboBox editor and custom painting displayed their
    value string even if it was unspecified.

  - Posix install script had comptibility issues with some non-bash
    compliant shells (bug #1620783).

  - Unable to edit unspecified text properties with clipper window
    (bug #1635432).

  - SetPropertyValue, when called on a child property, did not visibly
    refresh the parent.

  - In rare circumstances, it was possible to "select" last selected
    property of another page by double-clicking.



Version 1.2.5 ( Dec-11-2006 )

  New/Changed:

  - wxPython Bindings: Experimental support for creating custom properties
    and editors. See README-propgrid-wxPython.txt and test_propgrid.py
    for more information (carefully, since there are caveats).

  - Added wxPropertyGridManager::GetDescBoxHeight().

  - Makefiles for wxWidgets 2.8.0.

  - Added support for preprocessor define wxPG_USE_WXMODULE. Default is 1,
    but can be set to 0 inorder not to use wxModule to manage global variables.
    This may be needed in cases where wxPropertyGrid is linked in a plugin
    DLL. (patch #1609769 by Tim Stahlhut)

  - wxPython related source files are now in a separate archive.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - wxGTK, wxMAC: Fixed regression where the control was blank unless extra
    style wxPG_EX_NATIVE_DOUBLE_BUFFERING was defined.

  - wxMSW: Indentation in wxTextCtrl editors was not correct in all
    combinations of font and Windows OS version.

  - Setting value of a wxSystemColourProperty sometimes partially corrupted
    the value (specifically, wxColourPropertyValue::m_type). This was a
    regression caused by a buggy bug fix in 1.2.4.

  - Property's custom text colour was not always applied correctly on the
    value column.

  - "make install" didn't work. Note that the current fix is only a workaround
    (bug #1604887).

  - Compile errors with GCC 4.1 and newer.

  - wxImageFilePropertyClass, wxCursorPropertyClass and
    wxMultiChoicePropertyClass were missing export declaration.



Version 1.2.4 ( Nov-12-2006 )

  New:

  - Added SetPropertyTextColour. It sets text colour of properties and
    their children. Similar to SetPropertyBackgroundColour, it doesn't
    affect the caption colours.

  - Added SetPropertyBackgroundColour as an alias for SetPropertyColour.

  - Added SetCaptionTextColour. It specifically sets (caption) text
    colour of a category property.

  - Headers now identify WXMAKINGLIB_PROPGRID, which must be defined if
    wxPropertyGrid is to be linked statically while wxWidgets itself is
    linked dynamically (ie. WXUSINGDLL is defined)
    (patch #1593682 by Tim Stahlhut).

  - Improved combobox LnF under Windows Vista.

  - wxPython build scripts and readme updated to work with the 2.7 branch.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Child properties in deep hierarchy were not properly repainted when value of
    one of their parents was updated (bug #1578255).

  - Unspecified value did not work well with SpinCtrl editor.

  - DeletePropertyChoice and InsertPropertyChoice did not adjust the selection
    appropriately. Now, if current selection is deleted, then value is set to
    unspecified.

  - wxPython bindings: Setting string array and int array values didn't work.

  - Setting undefined wxColour value to a wxColourProperty or
    wxSystemColourProperty could cause assertion failure/crash (bug #1593459).

  - Internal global variables class was not correctly destroyed, potentially
    causing problems on app exit. Now this should be fixed by using wxModule.

  - GetCellDisableTextColour -> GetCellDisabledTextColour.

  - Fixed potential infinite focus event recursion scenario with
    wxEditEnumProperty (applied to wxMAC, at least).

  - wxPGCheckBoxEditor, wxParentPropertyClass and wxCustomPropertyClass were
    missing export declaration.

  - Compile problem with wxWidgets 2.7.2.



Version 1.2.3 ( Oct-15-2006 )

  New:

  - Added extra style wxPG_EX_NATIVE_DOUBLE_BUFFERING, which allows wxPropertyGrid
    to rely on system's native double-buffering, and thus conserve some memory
    and improve drawing performance.

  - Added EVT_PG_DOUBLE_CLICK (using event type wxEVT_PG_DOUBLE_CLICK) for
    intercepting double-clicks on properties.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Spurious property change events when pressing alt or ctrl, or when leaving
    the control area with mouse. This was especially annoying if a validator
    was used.

  - wxFloatProperty could crash with wxUSE_STL = 1 (bug #1561169, fix by Todd).

  - wxPropertyGridManager toolbar height was too small under Windows.



Version 1.2.2 ( Sep-09-2006 )

  New:

  - Extra style wxPG_EX_GREY_LABEL_WHEN_DISABLED added. It causes labels
    to become greyed along with the values when a property becomes disabled.

  - SetCellDisabledTextColour member function added to wxPropertyGrid.

  - Installer may try to automatically run bakefile if installing
    for an "unsupported" wxWidgets version.

  - Windows uninstaller does now much more through job. Namely, temporary
    files (*.obj etc.) and files specific to older wxPropertyGrid releases
    are removed where possible.

  - Unix uninstaller script added (contrib/uninstall-propgrid.sh).

  - wxArrayStringProperty now uses its validator to also validate the value
    in editor dialog (done when ok is pressed). No other properties do this
    currently, but just let me know if you need such thing.

  - Added virtual member function wxArrayEditorDialog::GetTextCtrlValidator.
    Implement it in a derived class to create a wxValidator for the wxTextCtrl
    in dialog.

  - Editor dialog of subclassed wxArrayStringPropertyClass can be changed
    easier - you only need to implement new virtual member function
    CreateEditorDialog() to return new instance of your own editor dialog
    class derived from wxArrayEditorDialog. To facilitiate this there are
    two new virtual functions in wxArrayEditorDialog - SetDialogValue and
    GetDialogValue. At the moment they are not used with any other
    properties.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Pressing enter in wxEditEnumProperty's editor didn't do anything useful but
    caused focus to be lost from wxPropertyGrid.

  - All wxKeyEvents, specifically those from editor controls, could not be
    intercepted. These events are now also sent to wxPropertyGrid itself,
    meaning they can be intercepted in EVT_KEY_DOWN/UP handlers of derived
    class or pushed wxEvtHandler.

  - Pressing NumLock could cause problems under toolkits based on X. This
    includes, for instance, wxGTK (patch #1554432 by rjmyst3).

  - Compile problem with gcc4.1+ (bug #1540414)

  - Trying to use wxMultiChoiceProperty with wxPGChoices that had values
    not matching string indices did not work.

  - wxPropertyGridManager::CreatePropertyGrid() was not virtual.



Version 1.2.1 ( Aug-12-2006 )

  New:

  - Much improved focus detection.

  - wxDateProperty added to advprops.h/cpp. It uses wxDateTime value type
    and a new DatePickerCtrl editor (altough TextCtrl editor works as well).
    There are two new attributes for it: wxPG_DATE_FORMAT (string - used with
    wxDateTime::Format. Set your locale for nice default value) and
    wxPG_DATE_PICKER_STYLE (long - the window style used when creating
    wxDatePickerCtrl).

    Member functions SetPropertyValue and GetPropertyValueAsDateTime have also
    been added to wxPropertyGrid and wxPropertyGridManager.

  - DatePickerCtrl editor added to advprops.h/cpp. Note that wxDatePickerCtrl
    resides in wxAdv library, so using anything from advprops may cause
    dependency for it. Since I don't want that to happen by default, you will
    need to define wxPG_ALLOW_WXADV somewhere (library project settings or
    top of propgrid.h, for instance).

  - SpinCtrl editor moved from samples to advprops.h/cpp. You need to call
    static member function wxPropertyGrid::RegisterAdditionalEditors()
    prior to using it.

  - Numerous wxASSERTs and wxCHECKs have been added to validate property ids
    and names (among other things).

  - wxPropertyGridEventHandler macro added for use with wxEvtHandler::Connect.

  - Added to readme a note about tar "lone zero block" warning message.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - On systems where wxPopupWindow was used instead of wxTransientPopupWindow
    (includes all systems with wxWidgets 2.6.1 or earlier), there was serious
    dysfunctionality and even crashes in some rare situtations (for instance,
    clicking wxPropertyGridManager toolbar button when a popup was open).

  - wxPython bindings: property help strings did not appear in
    PropertyGridManager's description box.

  - wxPython bindings: there should now be a lot more Python exceptions
    instead of plain crashes when an invalid property name is used.

  - #1521288 (Crash on Tab keypress)

  - When wxPG_EX_HELP_AS_TOOLTIPS extra window style was used, the help
    strings were still shown in the status bar (in addition to that they
    were shown as tooltips).

  - POSIX installer script didn't work if path to wxWidgets was relative.

  - EventObject of wxPropertyGridManager's wxPropertyGridEvents pointed to
    the underlying wxPropertyGrid instead of the main (manager) object.

  - Some inconsistencies in how Doxygen generated the documentation have
    been resolved.



Version 1.2.0 ( Jul-09-2006 )

  Start of a new Stable API branch. In the subsequent 1.2.x releases API will
  not be changed (albeit minor additions can be made) and internal changes not
  related to bug fixes will be kept at minimum.

  New/Changed:

  - Improved appearance when disabled (all text is greyed).

  - Added keyboard shortcut Alt+Down to push the editor button. You can change
    it to a custom shortcut with new member function
    wxPropertyGrid::SetButtonShortcut(keycode,ctrlDown,altDown).

  - wxPropertyGridManager::SelectPage() now supports page index -1 to
    indicate no selection.

  - Ability to subclass wxPropertyGrid and wxPropertyGridManager has been
    improved. See docs for details.

  - Section "Creating New Properties" in the documentation has been
    heavily revised to introduce how to subclass properties as easily
    as possible (ie. macros not necessary).

  - Added wxPG_VERSION macro. It is calculated as MajorVersion*1000 +
    MinorVersion*100 + Release*10 + Subrelease. For instance, version 1.2.0
    translates to 1200.

  - Added wxPropertyGrid::GetPropertyPtr(id/name).

  - wxArrayStringPropertyClass::OnButtonClick is now virtual.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - wxTextValidator didn't work with wxEditEnumProperty.

  - Fixed bug #1511342 (Cannot clear FileProperty when PG_FILE_SHOW_FULL_PATH = 0)

  - Fixed bug #1509826 (Expand buttons drawn in the wrong place)

  - Fixed bug #1510934 (Build fails on gcc 4.1.1)

  - Keyboard navigation with limited editing properties could provoke
    (harmless) assertion failure.

  - Custom wxPropertyGridPage did not trigger events in wxPropertyGridManager
    itself (for instance, property description did not appear when property
    was selected).

  - wxPropertyGrid::GetEditorControl() sometimes crashed with wxGTK.



Version 1.1.6 ( Jun-08-2006 )

  New/Changed:

  - Added attribute wxPG_FILE_DIALOG_TITLE for wxFileProperty. If set,
    the file selector dialog will use it as the title.

  - Added attribute wxPG_DIR_DIALOG_MESSAGE for wxDirProperty. If set,
    the dir selector dialog will use it as the message.

  - Added wxPropertyGridManager::RemovePage(pageIndex).

  - Addex extra window style wxPG_EX_HELP_AS_TOOLTIPS, which will
    display property help strings as tooltips instead of status bar text.
    However, the usual wxWidgets restrictions apply and therefore multiline
    tooltips are not created automatically (ie. line breaks are needed for
    long tips).

  - wxPropertyGridPage class can now be subclassed to create custom manager
    pages. wxPropertyGridManager::AddPage() has new last argument where the
    page instance can be given. Custom pages are mostly useful for handling
    page-specific events, altough some virtual member functions can be
    overridden as well (DoInsert, DoDelete).

  - wxPG_SPLITTER_AUTO_CENTER behaviour has been further tweaked.

  - Unix installer now uses configure's regen script to generate makefiles.
    As of consequence, build dir is now asked even if quick install is used,
    unless the dir is given as the second parameter.


  New Features for Creating User Properties:

  - OnCustomPaint can now be used to paint the entire item (ie. not just
    an image in front of the text, as previously). Requirement is that
    GetImageSize returns wxPG_FULL_CUSTOM_PAINT_SIZE(preferredHeight),
    or for flexible height, wxPG_FULL_CUSTOM_PAINT_FLEXIBLE_SIZE(preferredHeight).
    wxPaintedEnumPropertyClass has been added to the sample application as a
    demonstration how to do this.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Combobox focus and selection background drawing corrected.

  - Various problems with wxWidgets 2.7.0.

  - GCC 4.0 warning.



Version 1.1.5 ( May-05-2006 )

  New/Changed:

  - Hugely improved wxPG_SPLITTER_AUTO_CENTER behaviour regarding appearing/
    disappearing scrollbar.

  - Text length limiting. Works with any properties using text ctrl as an
    editor. Call wxPropertyGrid::SetPropertyMaxLength or wxPGProperty::
    SetMaxLength.

  - Attributes now work in wxPython (thanks to the wxVariant typemap I added
    to the SWIG interface). See readme of the bindings package for a single
    line example.

  - Property hiding. Use wxPropertyGrid::HideProperty(property,true/false),
    or wxPGProperty::Hide(true/false). NOTE! This overlaps the old priority
    system and cannot be used simultaneously.

  - wxSystemColourProperty: Selecting or setting custom colour from dialog
    no longer tries to find named match from the list of system colours.

  - Added attribute wxPG_FILE_INITIAL_PATH to wxFileProperty. If set, the
    selector dialog will use it as initial path.

  - wxPGChoices id used mainly with wxPropertyGridPopulator has been changed
    from type size_t to custom type wxPGChoicesId (which is currently void*).


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Current colour was not selected in the colour dialog of wxColourProperty and
    its kind (thanks Anthony Sommers).

  - Fixed bug #1467766 (Combobox is set to the wrong value for an empty property)

  - Fixed bug #1467760 (Can't tab from checkbox property on Windows)

  - Applied patch #1467753 by Julian Smart that solves various keyboard navigation
    issues with combo box editor, including:
    * Pressing Enter should not show popup.
    * Pressing Escape should close popup.

  - wxMSW: Pressing enter in list popup didn't select an item.

  - String property using attribute wxPG_STRING_PASSWORD exposed its value
    as plain text instead of asterisk sequence in its parent's summary string.

  - wxPropertyGrid::GetEditorControl() now returns the actual control
    instead of clipper window, if any.

  - Compile problems with 64-bit compilers.

  - Compile problems with wxWidgets 2.7.0.

  - Hopefully now compiles with Cygwin.



Version 1.1.4 ( Mar-22-2006 )

    IMPORTANT! There are changes in custom/user property scheme. See below.

  New/Changed:

  - Internal changes to make wxPython bindings reality.

  - wxWidgets 2.6.3 makefiles are included.

  - wxValidators are now used in a different way for textctrls - validation
    happens on change instead on modify. This prevents user from leaving the
    editor control if entered text is invalid.

  - wxIntProperty and wxFloatProperty now have default numeric wxTextValidators
    attached to them.

  - Added CanClose() method which returns false if value in active editor
    has been invalidated by a wxValidator.

  - ClearSelection and SelectProperty now return false if selection could not
    be changed (which would be the case if editor's validation fails).

  - AddPropertyChoice method now also updates an active editor control.

  - InsertPropertyChoice and DeletePropertyChoice methods.

  - wxPGProperty now has AppendChoice, InsertChoice and DeleteChoice methods.
    They also update active editor control.

  - New attribute: wxPG_FILE_SHOW_RELATIVE_PATH. For wxFileProperty and derivatives.
    Allows showing relative instead of absolute path. Base path is the value given
    for this attribute.

  - Moved the remaining wxPGxxx editor class headers to propdev.h.

  - Sample application is now split into two source files. The new one,
    sampleprops.cpp contains those more useful sample user properties.

  - Dialog positioning and sizer spacing should now be more appropriate with
    Windows CE.

  - wxPG_COMPATIBILITY_1_0_0 is no longer on by default.


  Changes in Creating User Properties and Editors:

  - OnEvent: Instead of calling CopyValueFromControl, method should simply
    return true when changing event was received.

  - Macros WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_STRING_PROPERTY_WITH_VALIDATOR and
    WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_STRING_PROPERTY now require an additional argument
    which can be either wxPG_NO_ESCAPE (no escape sequences, ie. newlines
    and tabs cannot really be used - good for wxDirProperty and such) or
    wxPG_ESCAPE (the classic mode).

  - wxPGEditor::AppendItem(wnd,label) replaced with
    wxPGEditor::InsertItem(wnd,label,index).

  - wxPGEditor::DeleteItem(wnd,index) added.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - wxDirProperty used escape sequences (such as \n and \t), causing dir
    selector dialog to always start from the scratch.

  - Custom delimeter for WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_ARRAYSTRING_PROPERTY_WITH_VALIDATOR
    (including sample wxDirsProperty) did not take effect until the value was
    set outside the constructor.

  - wxPGSpinCtrlEditor (from the sample app) crashed when value was
    entered manually.

  - Property value type builder macro WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_VALUE_TYPE_VOIDP_CVD
    did not work properly. Also added note about needing to use basic
    WX_PG_DECLARE_VALUE_TYPE macro with it.

  - Keyboard navigation did not work in combo popups.

  - Open Watcom problems.

  - GetFirstChild was not available in wxPropertyGridManager.

  - Windows CE popup window problems.



Version 1.1.3 ( Jan-15-2006 )

  New Features:

  - wxPopupTransientWindow now used for wxMSW and wxGTK popups if compiled with
    wxWidgets 2.6.2 or newer. This allows more authentic popup behaviour and
    using mouse input in wxGTK modal dialogs.

  - wxWidgets 2.7.0 makefiles.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Mouse cursor did not always change to resize-arrow when hovering on the
    splitter.

  - Various bugs with child properties set to have unspecified value (for
    instance, when a property's value is set to unspecified, it's parent's
    "summary" text now correctly reflects this).

  - In ANSI build, it should now be possible to enter any non-ASCII
    characters in editor dialogs of wxLongStringProperty and
    wxArrayStringProperty (thanks Milan Babuskov).

  - Editor dialogs of wxLongStringProperty and wxArrayStringProperty now
    correctly use parent wxPropertyGrid's font.

  - CollapseAll could corrupt the current selection.

  - wxMAC compile problem.

  - wxParentProperty should now work if it initially has no children.



Version 1.1.2 ( Dec-02-2005 )

  New Features:

  - wxPG_BOOL_USE_DOUBLE_CLICK_CYCLING (wxBoolProperty attribute to allow
    value cycling with double-click) has been re-enabled and *is now on by
    the default*. Focusing to the combo box is detected as the first click,
    so behaviour will be much smoother than before.

  - New Attribute: wxPG_COLOUR_ALLOW_CUSTOM. Custom colour choice of
    wxColourProperty, wxSystemColourProperty, and their kind can be disabled
    by setting this attribute to 0.

  - SetPropertyAttributeAll(attrId,attrVal) method allows setting an attribute
    for every single property (in both normal grid and grid manager). Just
    remember to call it *after* your grid has been completely built.


  Bugs Fixed:

  - Size given in constructor or Create did not work.

  - Shorter name for SetPropertyValueUnspecified (ie. SetPropertyUnspecified)
    was not available when v1.0.0 compatibility flag was set (which was the
    default).

  - In some cases wxPropertyGrid stole keyboard focus.

  - Left aligning the splitter (ie. SetSplitterLeft method) has been fine-tuned.

  - It was not possible to have user properties with name not starting
    with "wx".



Version 1.1.1 ( Sep-21-2005 )

  New Features:

  - New property editor: ComboBox. Just like Choice but without
    wxCB_READONLY flag.

  - New property: wxEditEnumProperty. Just like wxEnumProperty, but
    has wxString value and ComboBox as default editor.

  - New method: SetSplitterLeft. Moves splitter as far left as possible
    so that labels are still fully visible. Also, this is the new default
    splitter position when wxPG_SPLITTER_AUTO_CENTER window style is not
    used.

  - New event: EVT_PG_ITEM_COLLAPSED - occurs when property or category
    has been collapsed by the user.

  - New event: EVT_PG_ITEM_EXPANDED - occurs when property or category
    has been expanded by the user.

  - Initial Mac OS X compatibility has been reported (should build and run -
    thanks to Jan-Friso Schipper for working it out).

    NOTE: wxPropertyGrid::SetFont is reported to crash, so offending code in it
    has been commented out. However, if you are willing to debug the issue, you
    can replace line '#if !defined(__WXMAC__)' with line '#if 1' in propgrid.cpp:
    wxPropertyGrid::SetFont.

  - wxWidgets 2.6.2 makefiles.


  Bug Fixes:

  - wxFloatProperty and sample's wxArrayDoubleProperty had problems when
    locale was set to one using comma as decimal point.

  - When value image of property w/ Choice editor was changed (with
    SetPropertyImage method), image appeared in front of every line in
    dropdown, not just the current one.

  - WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_STRING_PROPERTY macro produced erroneous code.

  - SetSplitterPosition did not work  when called before grid's size was
    properly set (by sizer logic etc).

  - SetSplitterPosition was missing from wxPropertyGridManager.



Version 1.1.0 ( Jun-14-2005 )

  Attention, users of 1.0.x! Carefully read section entitled 'API Changes'.

  New Features:

  - When wxPropertyGrid loses focus, selected property now becomes greyed
    (similar to other controls).

  - wxValidator support methods:
        void SetPropertyValidator(id/name,wxValidator&)
        wxValidator* GetPropertyValidator(id/name)

    In addition, wxFileProperty, wxDirProperty (as well as wxDirsProperty
    in the sample app) now have built-in validators to filter out characters
    that cannot be used in paths.

  - Value image of any property can be set:
        void SetPropertyImage(id/name,wxBitmap&)
        wxBitmap* GetPropertyImage(id/name)

  - Editor of any property can be changed:
        void SetPropertyEditor(id/name,const wxPGEditor*)
        const wxPGEditor* GetPropertyEditor(id/name)

  - Property inheritance can now be traced, using IsPropertyKindOf method.
    For example, to find out whether property inherits from wxCustomPropertyClass,
    use:
        pg->IsPropertyKindOf( property, WX_PG_CLASSINFO(wxCustomProperty) )

  - wxStringProperty got wxPG_STRING_PASSWORD attribute. When it is used
    the value is echoed as asterisks and wxTE_PASSWORD is passed to the
    textctrl editor.

  - wxColourProperty (and wxSystemColourProperty) trigger colour dialog on
    wxButton click events (which means that changing the editor to
    wxPG_EDITOR(TextCtrlAndButton) is viable).

  - wxColourProperty's default editor is now now TextCtrlAndButton
    (wxSystemColourProperty still has Choice). To get the old editor, just use
    following code immediately after property has been added:

    pg->SetPropertyEditor(colourProperty,wxPG_EDITOR(Choice))

  - SpinCtrl editor added to the sample app. It is an example of user creatable
    property editor, with plenty of comments. On the third page of sample app
    there is a property "SpinCtrl" using it.

  - Items of wxFlagsProperty can now be changed with SetPropertyChoices.

  - Added documentation section "Customizing Properties (without sub-classing)".

  - WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_STRING_PROPERTY_WITH_VALIDATOR. Identical to
    WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_STRING_PROPERTY except it also declares
    wxValidator* DoGetValidator() const method.

  - WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_ARRAYSTRING_PROPERTY_WITH_VALIDATOR. Identical to
    WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_ARRAYSTRING_PROPERTY except it also declares
    wxValidator* DoGetValidator() const method.


  API Changes:

  - wxEnumProperty and wxFlagsProperty new constructor functions:
        wxEnumProperty(name,label,wxArrayString labels,value)
        wxEnumProperty(name,label,wxArrayString labels, wxArrayInt values, value)

  - wxPGConstants renamed to wxPGChoices. *

  - wxChar* arrays given as argument to wxEnumProperty, wxFlagsProperty,
    WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_CUSTOM_ENUM_PROPERTY, WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_CUSTOM_COLOUR_PROPERTY,
    and WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_CUSTOM_FLAGS_PROPERTY, *must now be NULL terminated*.
    Also, all such constructors and macros no longer have 'itemcount' argument
    (for the obvious reason).

  - Sub-properties (i.e. properties which have parent that is not category or
    root) can no longer be accessed globally by their name. Instead, use
    "<property>.<subproperty>" in place of "<subproperty>".

    For example:
        wxPGId id = pg->GetPropertyByName(wxT("Property.SubProperty"));
    Or:
        wxPGId id = pg->GetPropertyByName(wxT("Property"),wxT("SubProperty"));

    Clarification on sub-property OnChange event handling:
    - For wxParentProperty and wxCustomProperty, events will occur for
      sub-property. For those properties that inherit directly from
      wxPGPropertyWithChildren/wxBaseParentPropertyClass (wxFontProperty,
      wxFlagsProperty, etc), events occur for the main parent property
      only (actually, this has to do whether the children are "private" or not
      - see the attributes).
    - When wxParentProperty or wxCustomProperty's child gets changed, you can
      use wxPropertyGridEvent::GetMainParent to obtain its top non-category
      parent (useful, if you have wxParentProperty as child of another
      wxParentProperty, for example).

  - Manager's default is now to hide Alphabetic/Categoric mode buttons. Use
    new ex-flag wxPG_EX_MODE_BUTTONS to show them.

  - SetPropertyValueUnspecified renamed to SetPropertyUnspecified. *

  - wxRECURSE renamed to wxPG_RECURSE. *

  - wxKEEP_STRUCTURE renamed to wxPG_KEEP_STRUCTURE. *

  - GetPrimaryEditor renamed to GetEditorControl. *

  - Identifiers wxPGCtrlClass, wxCCustomTextCtrl, wxCCustomButton, and
    wxCCustomComboBox have been removed (use wxWindow, wxTextCtrl, wxButton and
    wxOwnerDrawnComboBox instead). *

  - SetPropertyChoicesPrivate renamed to SetPropertyChoicesExclusive.

    * When wxPG_COMPATIBILITY_1_0_0 is defined (which is default - see
    propgrid.h), this change is also implemented in its 1.0.x form.


  Dropped Features:

  - Support for wxWidgets versions earlier than 2.6.0.

  - Non-wxWindow-based custom controls.

  - wxPG_EX_CLASSIC_SPACING (defined to 0 with wxPG_COMPATIBILITY_1_0_0).

  - Double click cycles (wxPG_BOOL_USE_DOUBLE_CLICK_CYCLING) - mostly useless
    feature modeled from .NET version.

  - wxPG_NEW_COLOUR_SCHEME can no longer be used to revert to the old colour
    scheme.


  Other Changes:

  - Pressing ESC when editing value in wxTextCtrl editor cancels any
    changes (in addition to unfocusing the control, as previously).

  - EVT_TEXT (id = wxEVT_COMMAND_TEXT_UPDATED) events are now passed out of
    of wxPropertyGrid. This is useful if you want your app to know when user
    has started editing a property (since wxEVT_PG_CHANGED is sent only
    after changes are committed, ie. enter is pressed or focus changes).

  - GetFirstProperty, GetNextProperty and GetPrevProperty will no longer
    skip wxCustomProperty and wxParentProperty.

  - Unhandled editor button events are redirected to the grid's event handler
    (effectively makes custom editor button callback function obsolete).

  - wxFontProperty's "Face Name" sub-property has been changed to a
    wxEnumProperty (it was wxStringProperty). Drop down will show all
    available font faces.

  - Check box editor no longer receives keyboard focus indicator (if I can
    figure how to add it *only* when getting focus from kbd, then I will do
    that).

  - Added GetEditorControlSecondary which returns editor's button, if any.

  - wxBasePropertyClass is a new alias for wxPGProperty.

  - wxBaseParentPropertyClass is a new alias for wxPGPropertyWithChildren.


  Changes to Property Classes System:

  - WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_PROPERTY_CLASS now has base property argument, inserted
    to second place (i.e. its between property name and value type). Use
    wxBaseProperty when inheriting from wxPGProperty and wxBaseParentProperty
    when inherting from wxPGPropertyWithChildren.

  - Added wxPGProperty::DoGetValidator virtual method. If property does
    not have explicit validator, it is called when property's editor is
    about to be created. See wxPGProperty class reference for implementation
    details.

  - wxPropertyGrid::OnCustomEditorEvent's argument changed from wxEvent&
    to wxCommandEvent& - you need to change casting in any related Connect
    calls to accommodate this.

  - wxPGChoices (old wxPGConstants) has been transformed internally. Due
    to this, properties that need it now hold wxPGChoices m_choices instead
    of wxPGChoices* m_choices. wxPGConstantsUnref macros are no longer necessary
    in destructors.

  - Editor classes wxPGTextCtrlEditor and wxPGChoiceEditor are now available
    for inheritance in propdev.h.

  - wxStringPropertyClass is available for inheritance in propdev.h.

  - Replaced all m_constants members with m_choices.

  - Second argument of wxPGProperty::SetAttribute changed from "wxVariant" to
    "wxVariant&".

  - virtual const wxPGEditor* GetEditorClass () const; replaced with
    virtual const wxPGEditor* DoGetEditorClass () const;
    (since there is now non-virtual wxPGProperty::GetEditorClass)

  - Added wxPGEditor::GetName(). It is auto-generated with macros, and
    will return pointer to editor's name ("TextCtrl" etc).

  - Added wxPGEditor::OnFocus(). It is triggered when editor gets focus.
    For wxTextCtrl based editor, for example, it should select all text.

  - Old WX_PG_DECLARE_EDITOR_CLASS (which declares editor singleton
    *in header*) has been renamed to WX_PG_DECLARE_EDITOR.

  - WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_EDITOR_CLASS_CONSTFUNC renamed to
    WX_PG_IMPLEMENT_EDITOR_CLASS.

  - WX_PG_DECLARE_EDITOR_CLASS added - use it as you would DECLARE_DYNAMIC_CLASS.


  Bug Fixes:

  - wxUIntProperty did not render its value unless base or prefix was
    explicitly set (via SetPropertyAttribute).

  - WinXP/Win2K, wxWidgets 2.6.1: Improved indentation fix.

  - When mouse was leaving "slowly" via right edge through active editor
    control, correct mouse leave event was not triggered resulting in
    latest changes not being committed (though there was error notification
    in debug build).

  - GetCaptionBackgroundColour function name had typo (g was missing).
